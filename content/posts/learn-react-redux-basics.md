Today I learned the basics of [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) because the `state` requirements of the React app I have been building are now in need of a better solution.

I am a fairly experienced frontend developer, and I know how to use lots of technologies. But I was struggling with grasping the fundamentals of using React Redux. I have used [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) previously, which I picked up pretty quickly and I thought it would be similar. They are similar in concept, but not in execution. I think Vue deserves a lot of credit for their documentation as it is really good.

What I was looking for was a basic tutorial, the *most* basic. But every "basic" tutorial was how to make a *todo* app. But I honestly needed a *Hello world*, just to see how the code was wired together. This is from the redux documentation:

> Don't be fooled by all the fancy talk about reducers, middleware, store enhancersâ€”Redux is incredibly simple. If you've ever built a Flux application, you will feel right at home. If you're new to Flux, it's easy too!

I would agree in hindsight that it is relatively easy, but the path to that knowledge is shrouded in fog. It was time to find alternative education!

So if you are in the same position as me, I took to YouTube and found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSSpVLpuVWA) by **Learn Coding Tutorials**, which had the one thing I needed - to see the redux code working in a single file. I have included that code below for reference. This code is working on top of an app created via `create-react-app`.

### index.js
```javascript
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import App from "./AppSimple";

import { combineReducers, createStore } from "redux";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

function userReducer(state = "", { type, payload }) {
  switch (type) {
    case "updateUser":
      return payload.user;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const allReducers = combineReducers({
  user: userReducer
});

const store = createStore(
  allReducers,
  {
    user: "Michael"
  },
  window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
);

console.log(store.getState());

const updateUserAction = {
  type: "updateUser",
  payload: {
    user: "John"
  }
};

store.dispatch(updateUserAction);

console.log(store.getState());

render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

### App Simple
```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";

import { connect } from "react-redux";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Hello {this.props.user}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  user: state.user
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(App);

```
