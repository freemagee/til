This was largely driven by my personal interest, but I also saw React as a good career opportunity. Writing a personal blog helped in that process.</p><p>Fast-forward almost two years and I am working as a Software Developer, developing with React daily and learning TypeScript as well. This blog has sadly been put on the back-burner for quite a while and I am not happy about that.</p><p>I have limited personal development opportunity at the moment, being a father and working in a new-ish role in lockdown has meant personal projects have had to be put aside or even sunsetted.</p><h2 id=get-to-the-point>Get to the point!</h2><p>So in order to still work on personal projects I took a decision to try and simplify my development flow. Previously I ran my own Ubuntu LAMP instance on <a href=https://www.digitalocean.com>Digital Ocean</a>. I was quite happy with that for a while, and it was technology I was familiar with. But I no longer want to manage a server with the time I have available. So I shut it down. This had consequences! I hosted my personal website on there, plus a number of personal projects and I even hosted photos/files on there as well. I had to make some hard decisions about each.</p><p><a href=https://www.neilmagee.com>My personal website</a> - <em>LIVE</em> - This was a relatively simple static site (that needs some attention, but that is a seperate matter!) that I decided to put onto Netlify (for now). I was already hosting the source code on GitHub anyway, so it made sense. This is temporary, as I have plans to move this site (and this blog) to GitHub pages.</p><p>Hacker News Clone - <em>SUNSET</em> - I ran my own Hacker News (lite) clone. This was my oldest personal project and fulfilled a need I had at the time. It added a responsive re-skin to Hacker News and removed all functionality other than the links and the comments. I learnt a lot building it, and even re-built it over time. The last significant changes I made to it were replacing the front-end styles with <a href=https://tailwindcss.com/>TailwindCSS</a> and replacing the PHP based cron job with PM2 and NodeJS. Sometimes I miss this project, especially if I have 5 mins to kill somewhere.</p><p>Streak - <em>SUNSET</em> - I built a React PWA habit tracker over the summer of 2020. It is an app that has a purpose for me, but I also used the development of it to become more familiar with React <code>useContext</code> and <code>useReducer</code> I enjoyed working on it, but ultimately I stopped developing it around September of 2020, when I began my new role. This is probably the main project I want to re-develop, and I would need to re-develop it as the backend ran on PHP with JSON files and was not great! I would rather run this on a complete JS stack and am still thinking about what tech I would use and where I could host it. I would need an API with a database, and my current hosting stack does not offer that.</p><p>Photos/File hosting - <em>REPLACED</em> - For now, I have fallen back to Google to fulfill the needs of sharing photos and/or files. I would prefer to control this myself, but I have no time to setup my own cloud service, so that is a limitation I accept.</p><h3 id=the-future>The future</h3><p>I plan to move my static sites to GitHub pages and close my Netlify account. This simplifies my hosting and means I have one less account to manage. So that covers this blog and my personal website. I think leveraging free hosting with technology I am familiar with is win-win.</p><p>I need to find a back-end solution for APIs/Database/NodeJS that does not cost much per month (around Â£5 would be good). I do not have a good answer at the moment. I have been looking at Render/AWS and some other services. I need it to be super simple to setup, as again, time to spend on this is limited.</p><p>I am excited as I look forward to finding solutions and working in a more optimised manner. I am also looking forward to dumping PHP and working with NodeJS as a back-end technology. I know that once I find a stack that works, I can then begin to resurrect some sunsetted projects that I would be happy to work on again.</p></section><footer class=post__footer><ul class=post__tags><li class=post__tag><a href=/tags/meta class=post__tag-link><span class=post__tag-label>#</span>meta</a></li></ul></footer></article><aside class=post-siblings><nav class=post-siblings__ctrl><a class="post-siblings__nav post-siblings__nav--previous" href=https://til.neilmagee.com/post/hugo-content-organisation/ rel=nofollow>Previous<span class=post-siblings__nav-icon><svg id="Chevron_right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" viewBox="0 0 20 20" enable-background="new 0 0 20 20"><path d="M9.163 4.516c.418.408 4.502 4.695 4.502 4.695C13.888 9.43 14 9.715 14 10s-.112.57-.335.787c0 0-4.084 4.289-4.502 4.695-.418.408-1.17.436-1.615.0-.446-.434-.481-1.041.0-1.574L11.295 10 7.548 6.092c-.481-.533-.446-1.141.0-1.576.445-.436 1.197-.409 1.615.0z" class="post-siblings__nav-icon-previous"/></svg></span></a></nav><span class=post-siblings__more>More posts</span></aside></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=site-footer__inner><p class=site-footer__copyright>&copy; 2021&nbsp;<a href=https://neilmagee.com>Neil Magee</a>
