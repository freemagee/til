I have used &lt;a href=&#34;https://redux.js.org/introduction/prior-art#flux&#34;&gt;Flux&lt;/a&gt; like patterns only a handful of times. Mainly in Vue using &lt;a href=&#34;https://vuex.vuejs.org/&#34;&gt;Vuex&lt;/a&gt;. But it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last used one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in the middle of building a prototype App in React and the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; component was becoming unwieldy. It contained all the main state, all the functions that were passed to child components as props and the way things were going, it was about to become responsible for asyncronous data as well. That is too much for one component.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
