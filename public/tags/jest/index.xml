Often development involves tool configuration. I have lost many hours to this over the years. Something changes a version number and suddenly you are hunting through Stack Overflow and GitHub with a good idea of the problem, but lacking the &lt;code>magic inscriptions&lt;/code> to solve it. Or there are version conflicts. Today&amp;rsquo;s example is the latter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was writing a small tool for a maths problem, &lt;a href="https://github.com/freemagee/number-difference-table">Number difference table&lt;/a>, and I thought it would benefit from having some unit tests written for it. I wanted to test some of the calculations and using the UI over and over, or console logging had become tedious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I chose to use &lt;a href="https://jestjs.io">Jest&lt;/a> and installed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">yarn add -D jest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div></description></item></channel></rss>
