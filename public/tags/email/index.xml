&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt; Use &lt;code&gt;woff&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;woff2&lt;/code&gt; for web fonts in email&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been asked a question by our art director today about using web fonts in an email campaign that was being designed. The company we are designing for has a corporate identity that specifies certain font families. I had already begun to test this back in March so I had an idea of the state of web font support in email clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I answered him more definitively, I wanted to perform a few tests using our email marketing software &amp;mdash; Campaign Monitor &amp;mdash; to confirm what could be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
