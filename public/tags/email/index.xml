&lt;p>&lt;strong>TLDR&lt;/strong> Use &lt;code>woff&lt;/code>, not &lt;code>woff2&lt;/code> for web fonts in email&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had been asked a question by our art director today about using web fonts in an email campaign that was being designed. The company we are designing for has a corporate identity that specifies certain font families. I had already begun to test this back in March so I had an idea of the state of web font support in email clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before I answered him more definitively, I wanted to perform a few tests using our email marketing software — Campaign Monitor — to confirm what could be achieved.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
