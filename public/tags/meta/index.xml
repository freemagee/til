I have been doing a few algorithm challenges on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freecodecamp.org/&#34;&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;, which is a great resource. Whilst completing one titled &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Smallest Common Multiple&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; I had a look at what other solutions people had posted, and how they compared to mine. A user had put together a CodePen running &lt;a href=&#34;https://benchmarkjs.com/&#34;&gt;BenchmarkJS&lt;/a&gt; that contained about four solutions. I added my solution (below) to the benchmark test and the results were surprising.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Declarative vs. Imperative programming</title><link>https://til.neilmagee.com/post/imperative-versus-declarative-programming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 18:11:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://til.neilmagee.com/post/imperative-versus-declarative-programming/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned more about the distinction between &lt;em&gt;declarative&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;imperative&lt;/em&gt; programming. I have seen the terms used in various places, but I could not give a good explanation about what they mean. So with a bit of curiosity and I thought that I would get a better handle on the definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperative programming is like &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; you do something, and declarative programming is more like &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; you do.&lt;/p&gt;

I have probably thought of those terms as being synonymous with eachother and fulfilling the same needs. But I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
