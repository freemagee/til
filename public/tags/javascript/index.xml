I have been doing a few algorithm challenges on &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp&lt;/a>, which is a great resource. Whilst completing one titled &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Smallest Common Multiple&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> I had a look at what other solutions people had posted, and how they compared to mine. A user had put together a CodePen running &lt;a href="https://benchmarkjs.com/">BenchmarkJS&lt;/a> that contained about four solutions. I added my solution (below) to the benchmark test and the results were surprising.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
